BadStore Vulnerability Testing Checklist

1. Reconnaissance

- Discover IP address using tools like netdiscover or arp-scan

i did use netdiscover

netdiscover 
arp-scan -l -x

- Scan open ports with nmap (-sS -sV -A)

nmap -sS -sV -A -Pn 0.0.0.0

- Perform banner grabbing (nc, telnet, curl)

curl 0.0.0.0

- Identify web services and versions

80/tcp   open  http     Apache httpd 1.3.28 ((Unix) mod_ssl/2.8.15 OpenSSL/0.9.7c
443/tcp  open  ssl/http Apache httpd 1.3.28 ((Unix) mod_ssl/2.8.15 OpenSSL/0.9.7c
3306/tcp open  mysql    MySQL 4.1.7-standard

2. Web Application Enumeration

- Perform directory brute-forcing with gobuster, dirb, or ffuf

gobuster dir -u 0.0.0.0 /usr/share/dirbuster/wordlists/directory-list-lowercase-2.3-medium.txt

- Analyze HTML source code for comments and hidden fields



- Check for robots.txt or sitemap.xml
- Identify technologies using whatweb or wappalyzer

**3. Authentication Attacks**

* Test default credentials (admin\:admin, guest\:guest, etc)
* Brute-force login using hydra, Burp Suite, or wfuzz
* Check for password reset vulnerabilities
* Search source code for hardcoded credentials

**4. Injection Attacks**

* Test for SQL Injection (manual and with sqlmap)
* Attempt command injection
* Test for HTML or JavaScript injection (reflected and stored XSS)

**5. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**

* Test for reflected XSS using basic payloads (e.g., <script>alert(1)</script>)
* Test for stored XSS in comment forms or input fields
* Check for DOM-based XSS in JavaScript
* Try bypass techniques using onerror, img src, etc

**6. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**

* Identify functions without CSRF protection (such as password changes)
* Create CSRF proof-of-concept forms

**7. File Upload Vulnerabilities**

* Try uploading PHP, HTML, or disguised PHP files like .php.jpg
* Check for client-side file type restrictions
* Locate uploaded files and attempt to execute them

**8. File Inclusion**

* Test for Local File Inclusion using path traversal
* Test for Remote File Inclusion if the server allows it
* Try log poisoning or LFI to RCE

**9. Sensitive Information Disclosure**

* Look for sensitive data such as emails, passwords, or credit card numbers
* Search for backup files such as .bak, .old, .zip
* Check for exposed folders like .git or .svn

**10. Exploitation**

* Upload and access web shells such as c99 or php-reverse-shell
* Gain reverse shell access via command injection
* Use LFI with /proc/self/environ or logs to get RCE

**11. Privilege Escalation**

* Identify current user and privileges using whoami or id
* Gather system info with uname -a and other enumeration commands
* Look for misconfigured sudo permissions or SUID binaries
* Search for cron jobs or stored credentials in scripts

**12. Reporting**

* Take screenshots of each step and result
* Document tools, payloads, and methods used
* List all vulnerabilities found and exploited
* Include post-exploitation findings like flags or hashes
