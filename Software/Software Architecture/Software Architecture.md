# **Lecture on Practical Software Architecture**

Architecture, whether in traditional building construction or in software development, is fundamentally about designing and structuring complex systems to meet real-world needs.

In buildings, architecture blends art and science to produce spaces that are functional, durable, and aesthetically pleasing. In the software world, the same balance is required: creativity and technical rigor come together to create systems that not only work but continue to do so reliably and efficiently over time.

## **What Is Software Architecture?**

Software architecture refers to the **high-level structure of a software system**, focusing on the fundamental decisions that shape its behavior and performance.

Ralph Johnson, one of the pioneers of software design, once defined it simply as:

> “Architecture is about the important stuff, whatever that is.”

In practice, this means software architecture is concerned with **core design choices**—the ones that are hard and expensive to change later.

## **Key Aspects of Software Architecture**

When designing software, architects must consider not only **what the system does** (functional requirements) but also **how it does it** (non-functional requirements).

- **Functional requirements** describe the features:  
    e.g., in an e-commerce platform, users should be able to search products, place orders, and write reviews.
    
- **Non-functional requirements**, often called the “-ilities,” describe qualities of the system:
    
    - **Maintainability** – ease of updating and fixing the system.
        
    - **Scalability** – ability to handle growth in users, data, or transactions.
        
    - **Reliability** – stability and availability, ideally 24/7.
        
    - **Efficiency** – responsiveness and resource usage.
        

Architecture also must respect **constraints**, such as:

- legal compliance (e.g., GDPR),
    
- budget and staffing limits,
    
- deadlines for release,
    
- adherence to technical standards.
    

These often narrow the possible design choices significantly.

## **Prioritization and Trade-offs**

A key skill in architecture is **prioritization**—deciding which requirements matter most when they inevitably conflict.

- A strict deadline may require trimming features to deliver on time.
    
- A fixed hosting environment might reduce the need for portability but increase the emphasis on scalability.
    

This prioritization also helps avoid **over-engineering**—designing for hypothetical scenarios that may never arise.

The principle **YAGNI** (“You Ain’t Gonna Need It”) reminds architects to build only what’s necessary today, deferring uncertain features until they become essential.

## **Starting the Design**

Once priorities are clear, the next step is choosing an **architectural pattern** suited to the project’s context. Common patterns include:

- **Layered Architecture** – separates concerns into layers (data storage, business logic, user interface).
    
- **Event-Driven Architecture** – emphasizes asynchronous, loosely coupled communication between components.
    
- **Microkernel, Microservices, and Space-Based Architectures** – each optimized for different scales and use cases.
    

For example, a **layered architecture** fits many web applications:

- the database layer manages storage,
    
- the business logic layer enforces rules,
    
- the UI layer handles user interaction.
    

This separation supports maintainability and scalability.

## **Evolution and Scalability**

Software architecture is never static. Systems evolve as requirements shift and as usage grows. However, change can be **costly** if the architecture isn’t designed with foresight.

Scalability is a prime example. Designing a system that can handle millions of users requires careful early planning—otherwise, retrofitting scalability later can be prohibitively expensive.

## **Conclusion**

Software architecture is about much more than diagrams and patterns. It is a **discipline of balance**:

- between functional needs and non-functional requirements,
    
- between present priorities and future possibilities,
    
- between creativity and engineering rigor.
    

By focusing on the **decisions that truly matter** and resisting premature complexity, architects can create software systems that are robust, scalable, and maintainable.

For deeper study, exploring **architectural patterns** alongside **design patterns** will provide powerful tools for building clean, scalable, and sustainable systems.
